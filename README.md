1. backup
- **backup.bat**
  -   Google downsizing the volumn of my educational google drive account, I use this batch file for backuping my files with appropriate filename periodically.

2. search
- **search_ALL_project.py** & **search_ONE_project.py** & **search_filename.py**
  -   Implement the searching function in JetBrains IDEs by python, featuring with keyword searching and filename searching.
